Data Modeling, Engineering and Analysis of Employee Data

Utilizing various csv files and a SQL database, questions such as "Which employees were hired in a specific year" or list out the details of all employees or manager information can be answered.  The database was designed using an ERD diagram from https://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com/.  A copy of the ERD is in the Employee_SQL.png file. The design was used to create the schemata for the database. 

The six csv files were loaded into tables and imported to a sql database.  Besides the analysis described above, additional lists can also be created for each table in the database.  Additionally, the data also can be reviewed by specifying a specific first name and the first letter of the employees last name.

An inner join was used to retrieve information from the Sales and Development Departments. Lastly we find out how many employees share the same last name by counting the frequency of the name.
